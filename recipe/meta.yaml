  summary: Simple swig bindings for the GNU Linear Programming Kit
  description: |
    swiglpk is not a high-level wrapper for GLPK (take a look at optlang
    if you are interested in a python-based mathematical programming language).
    It just provides plain vanilla swig bindings to the underlying C library.
